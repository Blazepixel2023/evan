    <div class="content">
        <p>Today, I stand before you to unveil the real story that lies beneath the surface of recent events in the Crackpixel community, a popular Discord server. I am Hyperion, the respected owner of Blazepixel, and I find it imperative to clarify the misunderstandings that have occurred between Evan, the Crackpixel server owner, and myself.</p>

        <p>In the subsequent sections, you will witness an extensive account detailing the transgressions and alleged misconducts that have been associated with Evan's management style and behavior. This narrative is supported by testimonies from several individuals who were once a part of Evan's team and have firsthand experiences of the hostile and unprofessional environment fostered by him.</p>
        <img src="Proof_1.png" alt="Proof 1">

        <p>Our disagreement, which initially surfaced on Discord, has unveiled several unsettling allegations about Evan's approach towards management and his behavior towards team members. These concerns have been voiced by numerous individuals who were once part of Evan's team.</p>

        <img src="Proof_2.png" alt="Proof 2">

        <p>Some quotes from people who have worked for evan or knows evan<p>

        <p>SupernovaExists — Evan Is Such A Horrible Person, He Threatened To Raid Our Server, But Failed Miserably.<p>

        <p>Viremox V11 — ty for clearing that out, there was a lot more going on in the background, legal issues between me and him or better to say against him (This was the owner of crackpixel)<p>
        
        <p>Besides, there seems to be an underlying plot orchestrated by Evan to undermine our server, BlazePixel. The images below substantiate this claim, showcasing proof of the planned sabotage:</p>

        <p>Now some of you may not know this but Evan has actually been inside of 2 lawsuits and in both of them Evan folded below are some quotes and images of what Evan and his staff said to try and get out of this lawsuit.</p>

         <img src="Law8.png" alt="Law8">

        <p>Alaa we both know you man don't got the money to pay a designer </p>

        
        <p>Despite the turmoil, our determination to foster a community grounded in respect and collaboration remains intact. We invite those in search of a nurturing and inclusive gaming experience to join BlazePixel through the following link: <a href="https://discord.gg/vVKdpwEd">https://discord.gg/vVKdpwEd</a>.</p>

        <p>I extend my deepest appreciation to everyone who supported the creation of this narrative, particularly Roi and Thefladnag, whose insights have been instrumental in unraveling the truth.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your attention and understanding.</p>
        
        <p>Warm regards,<br>Hyperion</p>
        
        <p>In light of the above events, I would like to urge the gaming community to exercise caution when engaging with platforms managed by Evan. Based on the experiences narrated by several members, it seems highly likely that GamePixel may not offer a respectful and fair environment to its community members.</p>

        <p>To end this fit here is a diss track made by roi :D</p>
