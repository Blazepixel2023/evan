    <h1>The Truth Behind Evan</h1>
</div>

<div class="container">

    <div class="content">
        <p>First and foremost, I feel it's necessary to share an experience that has left many disappointed and frustrated. As the owner of BlazePixel, I recently encountered several unsatisfactory interactions with Evan, the owner of another server.</p>

        <img src="Proof_1.png" alt="Proof 1">
        
        <p>This disagreement, which initially unfolded on Discord, has brought to light several unsettling allegations about Evan's management style and behavior. These concerns have been echoed by several individuals who were once part of Evan's team.</p>

        <img src="Proof_2.png" alt="Proof 2">

        <p>Below, I have compiled some statements from various individuals who have had firsthand experiences with Evan. These quotes provide a glimpse into the alleged hostile and unprofessional environment fostered by Evan:</p>

        <blockquote>
            "I'm eating a burger" - TheFladnag<br>
            "Idk I'm not home rn" - TheFladnag<br>
            "I disagreed with Evan and his many faults while yes it takes discipline to run a server it doesn't require pinning it all on one person and setting an unreasonable date to server release" - TheFladnag<br>
            "You say goodbye to one, you say goodbye to all." - Steviebeenz<br>
            "Evan is an ass, I just joined and want to leave. He pressures people and isn’t willing to give people time to work. I don’t do well under pressure so I am not a huge fan. He treats others horribly, which is a huge red flag in my opinion. I am glad to help in small ways, but asking one person to do a huge project in a small amount of time is impossible." - BlueFalconHD<br>
            "Viremox was here" - Viremox<br>
            "Evan only cares about the money, and yes he invests it back into the server, but not into the actual development itself. He only does it to things like server hosts, and never pays his devs." - Alred<br>
            "Can you tell him to stop being sensitive and that he needs to learn the English language? Also, can you unban me, lmao?" - Aleks
        </blockquote>
        
        <img src="Proof_3.png" alt="Proof 3">

        <p>Further, it seems that Evan is allegedly planning to undermine our server, BlazePixel. Evidence to support this claim can be found in the images below:</p>
